* Ractors are Ruby's goroutines

* System threads - they are smart

* Goroutines - they are genius

* Ruby before 3.0

   It is, well, quite straightforward...

* Introducing GVL!

   a.k.a. Global Virtual machine Lock (GVL)
   a.k.a. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
   a.k.a. /(coming in a few slides)/

* Two questions

   - [ ] Why didn't GVL and using a single core help?

   - [ ] Why do we need GVL at all?!

* Parallelism ≠ Concurrency

* Parallelism ≠ Concurrency


   *First thread*: =0, 1, 2, 3, ... , 99=  /counting numbers/

   *Second thread*: ~A, B, C, D, ..., Z~   /counting letters/

* Parallelism ≠ Concurrency

   Parallel: ❌
   Concurrent: ❌

* Two questions (1/2)

   - [x] +Why didn't GVL and using a single core help?+
     *Answer*: Because threads are concurrent despite not being parallel.

   - [ ] Why do we need GVL at all?!


* Two questions (2/2)

   - [x] +Why didn't GVL and using a single core help?+
     *Answer*: Because threads are concurrent despite not being parallel.

   - [x] +Why do we need GVL at all?!+
     *Answer*: Because it protects Ruby interpreter's internal parts.

* +Global+ *Great* Virtual machine Lock

   former Global Virtual machine Lock (GVL)
   former Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

   /Note: GVLs are still present, one per Ractor/

* Ruby 3.0: Ractors were introduced (2020)

   And they still suffered from system threads' overhead

* Ruby 3.3: M:M vs M:N (2023)

* How to contact me (and why)
